# Notice_M3 Readme
A chrome browser extension that connects to Twitches chat channels and notifies users of increased rate in chat messages that are sent to the channel.

Notice_M3's use:
The purpose of Notice_M3 is to help users know if something of note 
has occured on a twitch stream that they have running, but are not actively watching by reading 
the rate of chat message additions and sending the user a clickable notification as a shortcut to said stream.

Future features to be added:
  - A timer that will set COUNT to 0 if THRESHOLD is not met within a timelimit.
  - An algorithm that will test for messages/min and will set a THRESHOLD.
      - Will need to create ranges for THRESHOLD, ergo will need to research via another application.
